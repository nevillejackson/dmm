\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.2in}|p{2.4in}}
Component & Name & Meaning \\ \hline
${\bm G(Ma)}$     & maternal additive genetic effect or breeding value &  sum of average effects on phenotype of an individual's dam's genes \\
${\bm G(Md)}$     & maternal dominance effect  & sum of deviations from average effect due to non-additive combination of gene effects within a dam's locus \\
${\bm G(Ma:a)}$   & maternal additive x additive epistatic effect & non-additive combination of additive gene effects across pairs of dam's loci \\
${\bm G(Ma:d)}$   & maternal additive x dominance epistatic effect & non-additive combination of additive and dominance gene effects across pairs of dam's loci \\
${\bm G(Md:d)}$   & matermnal dominance x dominance epistatic effect & non-additive combination of dominance gene effects across pairs of dam's loci\\ \hline
${\bm E(M)}$      & maternal environmental deviation & unexplained deviation of individual phenotype (assumed maternal environmental, or maternal developmental) \\
${\bm E(M\&C)}$    & within cohort maternal environmental deviation & unexplained deviation for individuals with same dam and same cohort \\
${\bm E(M\&!C)}$   & cross cohort maternal environmental deviation & unexplained deviation for individuals with same dam and different cohort \\   \hline
